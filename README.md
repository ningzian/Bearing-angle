This is the source code for our **IJRR** paper "A bearing-angle approach for unknown target motion analysis based on visual measurements". This file contains five numerical simulation experiments conresponding to Fig. 4 and Fig. 5 in the paper.

## Illustration of bearing and angle

An observer MAV observes a target MAV with a monocular camera. The bearing g and angle θ can be obtained from the bounding box that surrounds the target in the image.
