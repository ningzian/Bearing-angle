This is the source code for our **IJRR** paper "A bearing-angle approach for unknown target motion analysis based on visual measurements". This file contains five numerical simulation experiments conresponding to Fig. 4 and Fig. 5 in the paper.


## Illustration of bearing and angle measurements

An observer MAV observes a target MAV with a monocular camera. The bearing g and angle θ can be obtained from the bounding box that surrounds the target in the image.

## Running Experiments
- The source code has been tested with MATLAB 2021a.
- Each folder corresponds to one numerical simulation experiments.
- The folder's name indicates which experiment it corresponds to.

## Notice
- The simulation results may vary slightly between each run due to the random collection of measurement noises.
- The .mat files in "Fig5a_square_circular" and "Fig5b_square_straight" are the original data used in the paper.
- If you wish to reproduce the exact curves presented in the paper, please modify the variable of mat file name in the 'plot_my.m' script. For example:
